# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April  21, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Minimum steps to reach 1.

**Thoughts**: Interesting problem. Given a number, you need to count the number of steps to reach 1. In each step, you can either divide by 3 or divide by 2 or subtract 1. Among all the possibilities, you need to take the path with minimum numbers. It can be done by simple recursion. Memoization/tabulation can be done to calculate larger numbers/reduce time complexities.

### Day 1: April 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: MinWindowSubstring problem on python.

**Thoughts:** A code snippet from OUtco. Interesting problem.

### Day 2: April 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the "Tea Cozy" website project on Codeacademy's Front-end Career Path

**Thoughts** I've recently restarted coding on the front-end, and it's taking some time to implement the therocial knowledge of HTML & CSS into practice. There could hundereds of ways of doing the same/smilar things with CSS, and it's up to the dev (artist?) to pick the most aesthically appealing path, in perhaps, the shortest amount of time -- which, of course, requires, oiling up the fingers!
  Slow & steady wins the race they say.

### Day 5: April 26, 2021

**Today's Progress**: updates to the body section for the Tea Cozy

**Thoughts** Figuring out where & how to place the CSS elements is getting tricky: lots of trials and errors. I don't quite like this process; doing this via hand is one thing, but doing it via third-party code, where things are not directly manipulated is another.

### Day 6: April 27, 2021

**Today's Progress**: The Tea Cozy is nearly complete in its skeleton form; pehaps a couple bones are misaligned!

**Thoughts** Same thougts from day 6. I can place all the bones in their correct places -- no doubt about that, but hate doing it in a roundabout way. I need to wrap this up quickly & get back to "coding coding". If I were to draw this via hand, it would've taken 5-10 mins at most; I'm not liking wasting time at doing something so simple in idea for ...
