**Today's Progress**: Minimum steps to reach 1.

**Thoughts**: Interesting problem. Given a number, you need to count the number of steps to reach 1. In each step, you can either divide by 3 or divide by 2 or subtract 1. Among all the possibilities, you need to take the path with minimum numbers. It can be done by simple recursion. Memoization/tabulation can be done to calculate larger numbers/reduce time complexities.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
