# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April  21, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Minimum steps to reach 1.

**Thoughts**: Interesting problem. Given a number, you need to count the number of steps to reach 1. In each step, you can either divide by 3 or divide by 2 or subtract 1. Among all the possibilities, you need to take the path with minimum numbers. It can be done by simple recursion. Memoization/tabulation can be done to calculate larger numbers/reduce time complexities.

### Day 1: April 22, 2021

**Today's Progress**: MinWindowSubstring problem on python.

**Thoughts:** A code snippet from OUtco. Interesting problem.

### Day 2: April 23, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started working on the "Tea Cozy" website project on Codeacademy's Front-end Career Path

**Thoughts** I've recently restarted coding on the front-end, and it's taking some time to implement the therocial knowledge of HTML & CSS into practice. There could hundereds of ways of doing the same/smilar things with CSS, and it's up to the dev (artist?) to pick the most aesthically appealing path, in perhaps, the shortest amount of time -- which, of course, requires, oiling up the fingers!
  Slow & steady wins the race they say.
